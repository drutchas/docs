title: "Mintlify Growth Marketing 60-Day Plan"
description: "Breakout of first 60 day action items and deliverables"
---

**Objective**: Ramp quickly, internalize Mintlify’s product \+ customer DNA, and launch initial growth experiments to build a repeatable pipeline for mid-market and enterprise technical buyers (developers, PMs, technical writers).

I have broken this into two distinct but related fields of learning I will need to go through in the first 60 days. Knowledge onboarding and marketing onboarding. I want to anchor this around a few core tenants that will help guide this effort:

- **Predictable Revenue as North Star**: Every activity must ladder into understanding ROI and repeatability. Top of funnel efforts should provide a formulaic input output dynamic - given X investment of time and resources we should see Z output in terms of new users. Our goal is to figure out the variables to drive that formula.
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Balance**: Quick strategies to prove traction, paired with compounding investments (SEO, community, brand).
- **Collaboration**: Work closely with product, sales, and success to ensure growth efforts align to real user needs and enterprise buying motions.

## Knowledge Onboarding

### Days 0–30: Onboard myself into the product and culture

- Join sales calls, customer support calls, and product discussions to hear unfiltered user questions, objections, and use cases.
- Audit existing ICP definitions, buyer personas, and product positioning materials; test these against firsthand conversations.
- Map out who is using Mintlify, why they’re using it, and where friction exists (in buying, adoption, or expansion).

**Deliverable**: **User & Buyer Map**: Clear view of current users, their motivations, success stories, and blockers.

### Days 30–60: Depth \+ Strategic Context

- Deep dive on product vision (what’s next on the roadmap) and sales momentum (what pitches are resonating, where we’re getting pull).
- Cluster customers into self-serve adopters vs. enterprise prospects, mapping paths from self-onboarding to mid-market to enterprise.

**Deliverable:** Growth Opportunity Brief. Strategic clusters of high-potential accounts with messages/channels that can turn the flywheel.

## Marketing Execution

### Days 0–15: Baseline Audit

- Inventory existing marketing channels: paid, organic, SEO, events, partnerships, community, outbound collateral.
- Gather performance baselines: traffic, conversion, cost per lead, sales cycle data, channel ROI.

**Deliverable**: Channel & Performance Map going from current state snapshot with clear baselines for every channel.

### Days 16–30: Hypothesis Building

- Build an exhaustive hypothesis list:
  - Channels to test (developer communities, content SEO, PLG loops, outbound accelerants).
  - Messaging angles (speed to ship docs, AI-powered workflows, trust/security for enterprise).
  - Target personas and pain points.
- Start developing core collateral (one-pagers, case studies, landing page variants) aligned to enterprise buyers.
- Test new solutions in market that may provide new methods to solve for top of funnel development.

**Deliverable**: Initial Hypothesis Deck - Short-term vs. long-term growth bets, with aligned collateral. List of impressions from new solutions in this space.

### Days 31–60: Test & Iterate

- Launch first **short-cycle experiments** in top candidate channels (e.g. SEO content themes, LinkedIn/Reddit/Twitter community plays, targeted outbound sequences).
- Measure **time/effort → output** rigorously to establish baseline conversion metrics.
- Begin building the concept of **predictable revenue**: with X time and Y dollars, output is Z signups/pipeline.

**Deliverable**: Growth Experiment Dashboard with early signal on which channels drive repeatable, scalable pipeline.

**By Day 60, the output is:**

- A map of Mintlify’s user \+ buyer ecosystem,
- A channel baseline with tested hypotheses, and
- The first signals toward a repeatable growth engine for the enterprise pipeline.
